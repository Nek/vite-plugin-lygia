- [ ] abstract away "#include" directive processing and don't mix local shaders and lygia shaders resolution in one step
- [x] make hot reloading work with nested "#include"s
- [ ] maybe add more, switch to preprocessor directives like GL_GOOGLE_cpp_style_line_directive and GL_GOOGLE_include_directive
- [x] rewrite lygia resolver
